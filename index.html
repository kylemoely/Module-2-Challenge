        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>After graduating from Auburn University with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry, I took up a role
            as a Research Scientist for a molueclar diagnostics company for about three years. I have since decided to transition my career
            into the tech industry, getting started as a front end web developer.
